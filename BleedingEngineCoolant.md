# Bleeding Engine Coolant on a 2003 Toyota RAV4

## Intro
Removing air from the cooling system (also known as "bleeding" the system) is important to ensure the engine operates efficiently and to prevent overheating. Here is an easy process to bleed the cooling system of your 2003 Toyota RAV4:

## Tools and Supplies Needed

* Coolant (as specified in your owner's manual)
* Funnel
* Clean container or catch pan
* Gloves and safety glasses

## Steps to Bleed the Cooling System

Park the Vehicle: Park the vehicle on a level surface and set the parking brake. Ensure the engine is cool before starting.

Access the Radiator: Open the hood and locate the radiator and the coolant reservoir. Remove the radiator cap (ensure the engine is cool to avoid burns).

Fill the Radiator: Using a funnel, slowly fill the radiator with coolant until it is full. Also, ensure the coolant reservoir is filled to the appropriate level.

Turn on the Heater: Set the vehicleâ€™s heater to the maximum temperature setting and turn on the blower to its highest setting. This helps circulate the coolant through the heater core.

Start the Engine: Start the engine and let it idle. Keep the radiator cap off. As the engine warms up, the thermostat will open, allowing coolant to circulate. You may see air bubbles escaping from the radiator.

Top Off the Coolant: As the engine runs, the coolant level in the radiator may drop. Add more coolant as necessary to keep it full. Watch for large air bubbles escaping from the radiator.

Rev the Engine: Occasionally, gently rev the engine to around 2500 RPM for a few seconds and then let it idle again. This helps move air bubbles through the system.

Observe the Temperature Gauge: Keep an eye on the temperature gauge to ensure the engine does not overheat during the process.

Check for Air Bubbles: Continue to let the engine run until you no longer see air bubbles coming out of the radiator and the coolant level remains stable.

Cap the Radiator: Once no more air bubbles are present and the coolant level is steady, replace the radiator cap securely.

Check the Coolant Reservoir: Ensure the coolant reservoir is filled to the appropriate level. Add coolant if necessary.

Test Drive: Turn off the engine and allow it to cool. After it has cooled, check the coolant levels again in both the radiator and the reservoir. If everything looks good, take the vehicle for a short test drive to ensure proper operation and monitor the temperature gauge.

## Additional Tips

Coolant Mixture: Ensure you use the correct coolant mixture as specified in your owner's manual (typically a 50/50 mix of coolant and distilled water). Check if the coolant you buy is pre-mixed or if you need to dilute it (concentrated).

See [Coolant Type](CoolantType.md) for more information on the type of coolant to use in your 2003 Toyota RAV4.

Safety First: Always handle coolant carefully and avoid skin contact. Wear gloves and safety glasses.

## End
This process helps ensure that air is removed from the cooling system, allowing the coolant to circulate properly and the engine to maintain the correct operating temperature.
